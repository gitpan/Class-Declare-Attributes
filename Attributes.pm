=head1 NAME

Class::Declare::Attributes - Class::Declare method types using Perl attributes.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package My::Class;

  use 5.006;
  use strict;
  use warnings;

  use base qw( Class::Declare::Attributes );

  # declare the class/instance attributes
  __PACKAGE__->declare( ... );

  #
  # declare class/static/restricted/etc methods of this package
  #

  sub my_abstract   : abstract   { ... }
  sub my_class      : class      { ... }
  sub my_static     : static     { ... }
  sub my_restricted : restricted { ... }
  sub my_public     : public     { ... }
  sub my_private    : private    { ... }
  sub my_protected  : protected  { ... }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Class::Declare::Attributes> extends L<Class::Declare> by adding support
for Perl attributes for specifying class method types. This extension was
inspired by Damian Conway's L<Attribute::Handlers> module, and Tatsuhiko
Miyagawa's L<Attribute::Protected> module. The original implementation
used L<Attribute::Handlers>, but now simply refers to L<attributes>.

The addition of Perl attribute support (not to be confused with
object attributes, which are entirely different, and also supported
by B<Class::Declare>) greatly simplifies the specification of
B<Class::Declare>-derived class and instance methods. This should aid in
the porting of existing code (Perl, Java and C++) to a Class::Declare
framework, as well as simplify the development of new modules.

With the addition of Perl attributes, B<Class::Declare> methods can now be
written as

  sub method : public
  {
    my $self = shift;
    ...
  }

instead of

  sub method
  {
    my $self = __PACKAGE__->public( shift );
    ...
  }


=head2 Attributes

B<Class::Declare::Attributes> defines six method or subroutine attributes
that correspond to the six method and object- and class-attribute types
of B<Class::Declare>:

=over 4

=item B<:abstract>

B<abstract> methods are merely placeholders and must be defined in
subclasses. If called, an B<abstract> method will throw an error through
I<die()>.

=item B<:class>

B<class> methods are accessible from anywhere, and may be called through
the class, a derived class, or any instance derived from the defining class.
This is the class equivalent of B<public> methods.

=item B<:static>

B<static> methods may only be accessed within the defining class and instances
of that class. This is the class equivalent of B<private> methods.

=item B<:restricted>

B<restricted> methods may only be accessed from within the defining class and
all classes and objects that inherit from it. This is the class equivalent
of B<protected> methods.

=item B<:public>

B<public> methods are accessible from anywhere, but only through object
instances derived from the defining class.

=item B<:private>

B<private> methods are only accessible from within the defining class and
instances of that class, and only through instances of the defining class.

=item B<:protected>

B<protected> methods are only accessible from within the defining class
and all classes and objects derived from the defining class. As an instance
method it may only be accessed via an object instance.

=back

The attributes defined by B<Class::Declare::Attributes> are not
to be confused with the object and class attributes defined by
B<Class::Declare::declare()>. The clash in terminology is unfortunate,
but as long as you remember the context of your attributes, i.e. are they
Perl-attributes, or class-/object-attributes, the distinction should be clear.


=head2 Attribute Modifiers

B<Class::Declare::Attributes> supports the use of the class and instance
attribute modifiers defined by B<Class::Declare>. These modifiers may be
imported into the current namespace by either explicitly listing the modifier
(B<rw> and B<ro>) or using one of the predefined tags: C<:read-write>,
C<:read-only> and C<:modifiers>. For example:

  use Class::Declare::Attributes qw( :read-only );

B<Note:> The "magic" of B<Class::Declare::Attributes> that defines the method
attributes is performed during the compilation of the module it is C<use>d
in. To access the attribute modifiers, the C<use base> approach should be
replaced with the more traditional:

  use Class::Declare::Attributes qw( :modifiers );
  use vars qw( @ISA );
  @ISA = qw( Class::Declare::Attributes );

However, because B<Class::Declare::Attributes> (or more precisely
L<Attribute::Handlers>) operates before the execution phase, the assignment to
C<@ISA> will occur too late to take effect (resulting in an invalid attribute
error). To prevent this error, and to bring the assignment to C<@ISA> forward
in the module compilation/execution phase, the assignment should be wrapped
in a C<BEGIN {}> block.

  BEGIN { @ISA = qw( Class::Declare::Attributes ); }

For more information on class and instance attribute modifiers, please refer
to L<Class::Declare>.


=head2 Methods

=over 4

=item B<require(> I<class> B<)>

In the event that a B<Class::Declare::Attributes>-derived class needs to be
loaded dynamically, the B<require()> method should be used to ensure correct
handling of the B<Class::Declare::Attributes>-style attributes. B<require()>
is a class method of B<Class::Declare::Attributes> and should therefore be
called along the lines of the following:

  package My::Class;

  use strict;
  use warnings;

  use bae qw( Class::Declare::Attributes );

  ...

      my $class   = 'My::Class::To::Load';
         __PACKAGE__->require( $class )    or die;

I<$class> can be either a class name (as above) or a string containing the
definition of the class. B<require()> will return true on success and
undefined on failure, with C<$@> containing the error.

=back


=head1 CAVEATS

B<Class::Declare::Attributes> is distributed as a separate module to
B<Class::Declare> as it requires Perl versions 5.6.0 and greater, while
B<Class::Declare> supports all object-aware versions of Perl (i.e. version
5.0 and above).

The interface B<Class::Declare::Attributes> provides is not ideal. In fact,
some might suggest that it's 'illegal'. In some ways, yes, it is illegal,
because it has hijacked some lowercase attribute names that Perl has marked
down for possible future use. However, as of Perl 5.8.0, these attributes
are not in use (C<:shared> is, which is why B<Class::Declare> changed this
class of attributes and methods to C<restricted>), and so we may as well
take advantage of them.

This is an example of what can be done with Perl (especially if you're
willing to bend the rules), and who knows, maybe it's a glimpse of the sort
of capabilities we'll see in Perl 6.
