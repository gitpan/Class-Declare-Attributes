NAME
    Class::Declare::Attributes - Class::Declare method types using Perl
    attributes.

SYNOPSIS
      package My::Class;

      use 5.006;
      use strict;
      use warnings;

      use base qw( Class::Declare::Attributes );

      # declare the class/instance attributes
      __PACKAGE__->declare( ... );

      #
      # declare class/static/restricted/etc methods of this package
      #

      sub my_class      : class      { ... }
      sub my_static     : static     { ... }
      sub my_restricted : restricted { ... }
      sub my_public     : public     { ... }
      sub my_private    : private    { ... }
      sub my_protected  : protected  { ... }

DESCRIPTION
    Class::Declare::Attributes extends Class::Declare by adding support for
    Perl attributes for specifying class method types. This extension was
    inspired by Damian Conway's Attribute::Handlers module, and Tatsuhiko
    Miyagawa's Attribute::Protected module.

    The addition of Perl attribute support (not to be confused with object
    attributes, which are entirely different, and also supported by
    Class::Declare) greatly simplifies the specification of
    Class::Declare-derived class and instance methods. This should aid in
    the porting of existing code (Perl, Java and C++) to a Class::Declare
    framework, as well as simplify the development of new modules.

    With the addition of Perl attributes, Class::Declare methods can now be
    written as

      sub method : public
      {
        my $self = shift;
        ...
      }

    instead of

      sub method
      {
        my $self = __PACKAGE__->public( shift );
        ...
      }

  Attributes
    Class::Declare::Attributes defines six method or subroutine attributes
    that correspond to the six method and object- and class-attribute types
    of Class::Declare:

    :class
        class methods are accessible from anywhere, and may be called
        through the class, a derived class, or any instance derived from the
        defining class. This is the class equivalent of public methods.

    :static
        static methods may only be accessed within the defining class and
        instances of that class. This is the class equivalent of private
        methods.

    :restricted
        restricted methods may only be accessed from within the defining
        class and all classes and objects that inherit from it. This is the
        class equivalent of protected methods.

    :public
        public methods are accessible from anywhere, but only through object
        instances derived from the defining class.

    :private
        private methods are only accessible from within the defining class
        and instances of that class, and only through instances of the
        defining class.

    :protected
        protected methods are only accessible from within the defining class
        and all classes and objects derived from the defining class. As an
        instance method it may only be accessed via an object instance.

    The attributes defined by Class::Declare::Attributes are not to be
    confused with the object and class attributes defined by
    Class::Declare::declare(). The clash in terminology is unfortunate, but
    as long as you remember the context of your attributes, i.e. are they
    Perl-attributes, or class-/object-attributes, the distinction should be
    clear.

  Attribute Modifiers
    Class::Declare::Attributes supports the use of the class and instance
    attribute modifiers defined by Class::Declare. These modifiers may be
    imported into the current namespace by either explicitly listing the
    modifier (rw and ro) or using one of the predefined tags: ":read-write",
    ":read-only" and ":modifiers". For example:

      use Class::Declare::Attributes qw( :read-only );

    Note: The "magic" of Class::Declare::Attributes that defines the method
    attributes is performed during the compilation of the module it is
    "use"d in. To access the attribute modifiers, the "use base" approach
    should be replaced with the more traditional:

      use Class::Declare::Attributes qw( :modifiers );
      use vars qw( @ISA );
      @ISA = qw( Class::Declare::Attributes );

    However, because Class::Declare::Attributes (or more precisely
    Attribute::Handlers) operates before the execution phase, the assignment
    to @ISA will occur too late to take effect (resulting in an invalid
    attribute error). To prevent this error, and to bring the assignment to
    @ISA forward in the module compilation/execution phase, the assignment
    should be wrapped in a "BEGIN {}" block.

      BEGIN { @ISA = qw( Class::Declare::Attributes ); }

    For more information on class and instance attribute modifiers, please
    refer to Class::Declare.

CAVEATS
    Class::Declare::Attributes is distributed as a separate module to
    Class::Declare as it requires Perl versions 5.6.0 and greater, while
    Class::Declare supports all object-aware versions of Perl (i.e. version
    5.0 and above). This is a necessary requirement of Attribute::Handlers.

    The interface Class::Declare::Attributes provides is not ideal. In fact,
    some might suggest that it's 'illegal'. In some ways, yes, it is
    illegal, because it has hijacked some lowercase attribute names that
    Perl has marked down for possible future use. However, as of Perl 5.8.0,
    these attributes are not in use (":shared" is, which is why
    Class::Declare changed this class of attributes and methods to
    "restricted"), and so we may as well take advantage of them.

    This is an example of what can be done with Perl (especially if you're
    willing to bend the rules), and who knows, maybe it's a glimpse of the
    sort of capabilities we'll see in Perl 6.
